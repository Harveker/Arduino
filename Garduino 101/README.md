The Garduino 101 is a open and free project, design to help with the basis of the daily gardening. 
The project is focused in engaging myself into the world of MCU's.
As well as a method to develop a usable, low cost maintence, automatized system, that anyone can modify as they please. 
Bringing diversity (if the project get some visibility of course) and helping with the science and the research in the topic.
If you're here, i hope you can help me or may i help you.
Thank you for being here.
